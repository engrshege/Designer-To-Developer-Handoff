# Designer-To-Developer-Handoff
Designer To Developer Handoff is a repository standing in as the Habitual Landing Page which is a practice assessment from the ZeroToMastery's (ZTM) Product Design Course. I placed it on Github so I could follow up closely on completing the assessment as a means to improve my Product Design to Developer skill.
