# Designer To Developer Handoff
Designer To Developer Handoff is a repository standing in as the Habitual Landing Page which is a practice assessment from the ZeroToMastery's (ZTM) Product Design Course (Complete Web & Mobile Designer in 2023: UI/UX, Figma, + more by Andrei Neagoie & Daniel Schifano.). I placed it on Github so I could follow up closely on completing the assessment as a means to improve my Product Design to Developer skill.
